All Your Base64
===============

...is a really simple and nice looking base64 conversion website. It will be most useful when used with [mailTo.js](https://github.com/jenius/mailTo), a jquery plugin that I'm working on to make putting emails on websites simple, secure, and convenient for users.

Currently in development and not even close to stable or presentable.
